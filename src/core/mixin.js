/**
 * The Mixin model provides a convenient way for Jermaine
 * applications to "mix in" additional functionality to a model,
 * from outside the model's initial definition.
 * 
 * The ability to add features (methods and/or attributes) to a
 * Jermaine model outside its initial definition already exists in
 * Jermaine -- this Mixin model does not actually add new
 * functionality to Jermaine; it just provides a convenient
 * pattern for grouping additional features together and applying
 * them to a model as a group.
 * 
 * The Mixin model maintains an internal list of functions, called
 * mixin functions, and provides an add() method for adding a
 * function to that list.
 * 
 * The apply() method calls all of the mixinfunctions that have been
 * added to the list, passing each one the same arguments
 * that were passed to the apply() function itself.
 * 
 * That's it.  That's all the Mixin class does.  It's up to you to
 * put whatever jermaine-model-extending code you want in the
 * mixin functions you add to the Mixin; the Mixin simply serves
 * as a place to hold them all, and a convenient way to execute
 * them all at once.
